## Introduction

The Udemy Courses Analysis project examines the extensive dataset from one of the world's largest online learning platforms to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to course performance, subscriber preferences, and revenue generation. With over 12 million subscribers and 3,682 records of courses from 4 subjects (Business Finance, Graphic Design, Musical Instruments, and Web Development) 

This project analyzes Udemy's online learning platform performance through an interactive dashboard that examines subscriber behavior, course effectiveness, and revenue patterns across different subject categories and levels.

## Analysis
### What is the Subscriber Satisfaction Score: 
Analysis of course ratings across Udemy shows an average platform score of 0.61, with significant variation by category. Top-rated courses like Piano & Keyboard (0.96) demonstrate the potential ceiling for quality, while many courses fall below the platform average.

### What is the Course Completion Percentage:
The dashboard reveals completion patterns vary significantly by subject area. Web Development courses show the highest completion rate among paid courses, while free courses across all categories show approximately 25-30% lower completion rates.

### Student Learning Engagement Indicator:
With 575K reviews across 12M subscribers, the platform shows a 4.8% overall feedback rate. Analysis indicates higher engagement in technical courses (Web Development) compared to artistic courses (Musical Instruments).

### Annual Growth in Course Offerings:
Year-over-year course catalog expansion shows dramatic growth from 2011-2017 (total increase of 17,452.52%), with the most significant acceleration occurring after 2014, particularly in high-demand categories.

### Comparison of Free vs Paid Course Performance:
While free courses attract more initial subscribers (315,675 free vs. paid), paid courses generate all platform revenue ($244K) and show significantly higher quality ratings, completion rates, and student satisfaction metrics.

### Category Performance Analysis:
Web Development emerges as the strongest performing category in both subscriber numbers and revenue generation, followed by Business Finance, Graphic Design, and Musical Instruments, indicating varying levels of market demand across subjects.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Technical skills courses dominate platform performance, capturing 47% of subscribers and 56% of total revenue. While free courses drive initial platform engagement, they show lower completion rates and satisfaction scores. The platform experienced exponential growth (17,452% increase) between 2011-2017, with significant acceleration after 2014. Technical subject areas demonstrate both sustained subscriber growth and higher average ratings. Quality inconsistency exists across the platform (average rating 0.61) with top performers reaching 0.96, and subscriber engagement correlates more strongly with course quality than price point. 

Emphasize quality to achieve higher ratings (above 0.8) which correlates with stronger review numbers. Develop more beginner-level courses across all subjects to capitalize on entry-level demand and also leverage free courses to upsell to paid courses.
